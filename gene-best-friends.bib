In this paper we present the first study of utilizing multiple queries in cluster-based document retrieval; that is, using information induced from clusters of similar documents to rank documents. Specifically, we propose a conceptual framework of retrieval templates that can adapt cluster-based document retrieval methods, originally devised for a single query, to leverage multiple queries. The adaptations operate at the query, document list and similarity-estimate levels. Retrieval methods are instantiated from the templates by selecting, for example, the clustering algorithm and the cluster-based retrieval method. Empirical evaluation attests to the merits of the retrieval templates with respect to very strong baselines: state-of-the-art cluster-based retrieval with a single query and highly effective fusion of document lists retrieved for multiple queries. In addition, we present findings about the impact of the effectiveness of queries used to represent an information need on (i) cluster hypothesis test results, (ii) percentage of relevant documents in clusters of similar documents, and (iii) effectiveness of state-of-the-art cluster-based retrieval methods.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2020 ACM SIGIR on International Conference on Theory of Information Retrieval}, pages = {33–40}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {document retrieval, cluster-based document retrieval, cluster hypothesis}, location = {Virtual Event, Norway}, series = {ICTIR '20} }

Genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrates molecular alterations to EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways in previously untreated tumors. Therefore, this study uses bioinformatics algorithms to delineate interactions resulting from EGFR inhibitor use in cancer cells with these genetic alterations. We modify the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line model to simulate cancer cells with constitutive activation of EGFR, HRAS, and PI3K in a controlled genetic background. We then measure gene expression after treating modified HaCaT cells with gefitinib, afatinib, and cetuximab. The CoGAPS algorithm distinguishes a gene expression signature associated with the anticipated silencing of the EGFR network. It also infers a feedback signature with EGFR gene expression itself increasing in cells that are responsive to EGFR inhibitors. This feedback signature has increased expression of several growth factor receptors regulated by the AP-2 family of transcription factors. The gene expression signatures for AP-2alpha are further correlated with sensitivity to cetuximab treatment in HNSCC cell lines and changes in EGFR expression in HNSCC tumors with low CDKN2A gene expression. In addition, the AP-2alpha gene expression signatures are also associated with inhibition of MEK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways in the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) data. These results suggest that AP-2 transcription factors are activated as feedback from EGFR network inhibition and may mediate EGFR inhibitor resistance.}, number={45}, journal={Oncotarget}, author={Fertig, Elana J. and Ozawa, Hiroyuki and Thakar, Manjusha and Howard, Jason D. and Kagohara, Luciane T. and Krigsfeld, Gabriel and Ranaweera, Ruchira S. and Hughes, Robert M. and Perez, Jimena and Jones, Siân and et al.}, year={2016}, month={Nov}, pages={73845–73864} },

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis ({WGCNA}) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
{RESULTS}: The {WGCNA} R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings.
{CONCLUSION}: The {WGCNA} package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/{CoexpressionNetwork}/Rpackages/{WGCNA}.},

	abstract = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that {RNA}-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content ({GC}-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as {GC}-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},
