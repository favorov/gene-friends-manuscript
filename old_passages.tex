We recall that the attention matrix $\mathcal{A}$ is the only input for the statistical test. Each its element $a_{ij}$ is the value of attention that a collection $c_j \in C$ pays to a tag $t_i \in T$

Its $j$-th  column corresponds to collection $c_j$, and we denote it as $\mathcal{A}_{:j} =(a_{1j}, \dots a_{nj})'$ (with $'$ being transposition). By modeling assumptions, elements in $\mathcal{A}_{:j}$ have the same distribution $P_j$ and are independent.

Its $i$-th row corresponds to tag $t_i$, and we denote it as $\mathcal{A}_{i:} = (a_{i1}, \dots, a_{ik})$.
By modeling assumptions, elements in $\mathcal{A}_{i:}$ are independent.
